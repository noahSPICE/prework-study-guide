# One Prework Study Guide Webpage To Rule Them All

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
My motivation is to make my firsty ever website that boosts my confidence as a developer, get me acclimated to different coding terminologies and to double as a study guide.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
As noted in the first response, this will serve as a valuable tool for me throughout the entire bootcamp experience. It gives me something to look at when I envevitably get stuck somewhere.

- What problem does it solve?
It solves two problems: first, it solves my issue of having ZERO experience in coding whatsoever and second, it gives me a easy-to-access study guide and index for the different terms I wil learn through my coding journey.

- What did you learn?
Too much to put into this one document! Learned the basics of JavaScript, CSS, Git and HTML. I still have a lot to learn, but this has been a great start so far.

- [Usage](#usage)
Each section contains notes about a specific coding language such as HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. Each section is labeled and easy to navigate. It is user friendly, not to mention, it is my first ever website! The website serves as a constant reminder that coding takes a lot of work... but it is certainly doable and able to be taught. Not only that, but it also serves as a study guide for me to refer to during the course.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
